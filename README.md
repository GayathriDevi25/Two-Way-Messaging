This project is a deep learning-based chatbot using PyTorch for text classification. It processes user input through tokenization, stemming, and a bag-of-words model. 
The neural network is trained with predefined patterns and responses stored in intents.json.
To use it, install dependencies with pip install torch nltk numpy, then train the model by running python train.py.
Once trained, the chatbot can be started with python chat.py.
